          Onam is an annual Indian harvest festival celebrated predominantly by the Hindus of Kerala.
          A major annual event for Keralites, it is the official festival of the state and includes a spectrum of cultural event.
         Onam commemorates Vamana and King Mahabali. According to Hindu legends, Onam is celebrated in Kerala in remembrance of the good governance under the rule of daitya king Mahabali,
          a mythical king who once ruled Kerala. The legend holds that jealous of Mahabali's popularity and his power, the devas and gods conspired to end his reign.
          They sent Vamana to earth in the form of a dwarf Brahmin who trampled Mahabali to patala (netherworld). Vamana asked Mahabali for three feet of land as his wish from the generous Mahabali.
          Since denying gifts to Brahmin is considered a sacrilege, Mahabali agreed to fulfill Vamana’s wish.
          In the first two feet Vamana measured the entirety of universe, leaving nowhere to place his third foot. Mahabali offered his own head to place his third feet making the wish complete.
          However, witnessing Mahabali’s generosity, Vishnu granted the king's sole wish to visit his land and people once every year.
          This homecoming of Mahabali is celebrated as Onam in Kerala every year
